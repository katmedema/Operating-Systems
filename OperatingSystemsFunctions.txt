One of the main functions of an operating system is to provide an interface between the user and the hardware. When the operating system has a graphical user interface, a task can be executed by clicking certain images or icons, with a mouse, to execute the commands. If the operating system has a command line interface the user types, with a keyboard, the commands to give the hardware instructions on which tasks to perform.
