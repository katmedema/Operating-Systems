One of the main functions of an operating system is to provide an interface between the user and the hardware. When the operating system has a graphical user interface, a task can be executed by clicking certain images or icons, with a mouse, to execute the commands. If the operating system has a command line interface the user types, with a keyboard, the commands to give the hardware instructions on which tasks to perform.
The operating system manages the devices that can be used with the hardware. These include items such as a mouse, keyboard, or printer. The operating system will act as a kind of translator by using “drivers” to communicate with the devices.
The operating system also manages the system resources.  For example if you were printing multiple documents the operating system would output the first print request and spool any subsequent print requests until the system is ready to output them.  It will also manage the memory of the hardware so that it executes more efficiently.
